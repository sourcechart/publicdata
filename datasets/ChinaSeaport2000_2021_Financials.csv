China’s Ministry of Commerce was the source of funding and it committed RMB 159 million in total. Phase 1 of the Alto do Bandim Fishing Port Project was financed by the African Development Bank with US$4 million and it included the construction of a pier, a fish auction and an administrative building. Phase 2 involved the construction of a 50-meter-long floating dock, new breakwaters, administrative and fishery trade buildings, connecting roads, and drainage and sewage pipe networks within a 300-meter area.  China Railway Guangzhou Engineering Group Corporation (CRGEG) was the contractor responsible for implementation. On October 31, 2018, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. Then, on March 22, 2019, Guinea-Bissau’s Minister of Fisheries, Adiatu Djaló Nandigna, announced that Phase 2 would be completed in the next two years. However, project implementation was temporarily halted in the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 epidemic. Work resumed on July 15, 2020.

(2014) 43 TOTAL NO. (337)] for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. The proceeds of the loan were then on-lent to the Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance of CFA 3 billion in an escrow account (accessible to the lender).The proceeds of the PBC were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $933.4 million EPC contract between Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA) and China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on January 11, 2013. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire was responsible for financing the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($140,010,000). African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) also arranged an EUR 250 million syndicated bridge loan facility in 2014 for this project.According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021. CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA’s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Société Générale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project.",Completion,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank)|Bolloré Group|Ecobank|JPMorgan Chase & Co.|Matha Capital|Société Générale S.A.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a revenue account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($497,468,255) of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy. The Republic of Cameroon originally agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost, but it later renegotiated and reportedly did not pay for this component of the project. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 191.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.  The purpose of the project was undertake the first phase of the construct of a deep seaport in the Atlantic coast town of Kribi, 300 km south of Yaounde. Upon completion, the main port was expected to receive large vessels with a capacity close to 100,000 tons.  Construction began on January 10, 2010, and an official groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 8, 2011. The project was completed on April 6, 2015. Project ID#350 captures the China Eximbank PBC for Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. China Eximbank also provided financing for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project via a GCL (as captured via Project ID#53116) as well as a PBC (as captured via Project ID#53396). Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project was completed on March 2, 2018.  Following a call for tenders, the right to manage the container terminal of the port was awarded to a consortium made up of CHEC and two French companies, Bolloré and CMA CGM, while the right to operate the multipurpose terminal went to the consortium of the French Necotrans and the Cameroonian Kribi Port Multi Operators (KPMO).There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed).

Then, on November 15, 2014, the Government of Mozambique ratified this loan agreement. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 7 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. This project involved the construction of a dock that is 377 meters long (compared with 188 meters previously) in order to allow 16 industrial vessels to be moored simultaneously. It also involved the installation of six cold stores, an ice factory with a capacity of 60 tonnes per day, a fish processing room with a capacity of 50 tonnes per day, and a handling capacity of 700,000 tons per year. Beira’s fishing port was destroyed by cyclone Eline, which struck the provincial capital of Sofala in February 2000. China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 27, 2016 and the project was officially completed and handed over to the authorities in Mozambique on October 28, 2019.There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira Fishing Port Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).",Completion,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,ODA-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Government of Mozambique,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.",,"$132,824,857.50",-19.816415,34.8368554,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/172425131,precise

Cuvenpetrol and Huanqui also signed a separate letter of intent that involves a contract to build a liquefied natural gas project, including a regasifcation plant built at or near the refinery (See: China to Expand $6bn Cuban Refinery).  The expansion of Cuba's Cienfuegos oil refinery, the largest in the country, as well as the addition of a LNG terminal attachment are to be funded via a single loan from China Eximbank, with a sovereign guarantee of using Venezuelan oil as collateral (See: China, Cuba agree on refinery project, new loans and China signs letter of intent to redo Cuba refinery). China Eximbank has agreed to finance 85% of the total cost of the project, which is reportedly $6 billion USD (See: China signs letter of intent to redo Cuba refinery).  This loan will be secured by China Export & Credit Insurance Corp. (SINOSURE) (See: China company to lead $6 bln Cuba refinery update); therefore the financing is likely export buyer's credits. The refinery has an estimated cost of $4.5 billion and the LNG terminal is expected to cost $1.3 billion (See: INDUSTRY ANALYSIS)The expansion will increase the refinery's capacity from 65,000 barrels per day to 150,000 barrels per day (See: Cuba refinery in trouble on Venezuela supply cut).  The LNG (gas liquefaction) terminal will have the capacity to process 2 million tons of gas annually and also includes a 150 MW electricity generation plant (See: RESUMEN ECONÓMICO ANUAL 2010).  China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC)'s Haunqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation is the contractor for the expansion (See: RESUMEN ECONÓMICO ANUAL 2010).

The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial contract (No. PDSA-GHDC-01) worth $476,779,000.42 that was signed by China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC), China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), and Port of Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) on August 16, 2014. PDSA is a joint venture between the Government of Dijbouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Group (23.5% equity stake). PDSA was responsible for the remainder ($132,306,173.17) of the commercial contract cost. In 2016, PDSA also obtained a $50 million loan (captured via Project ID#91872 from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for the Doraleh Multipurpose Port Project. The Government of Djibouti issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the ICBC loan on May 3, 2016. The objective of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP) was to relieve pressure on the Port of Djibouti SA as the pace of trade between Africa and the rest of the world increased. More specifically, the DMP project component was designed to expand the existing port's capacity by adding seven new berths in the first phase, including a roll on/roll off facility, with a total length of 1,200 meters. Each berth was meant to accommodate ships with cargoes of up to 100,000 tons in a naturally deep-water bay that will require minimal dredging. Upon completion, the designed annual throughput of bulk cargo volume and the container volume were to be 7.08 million tons and 200,000 TEU, respectively. The livestock port at Damerjog, located in the Arta region 13 km south-east of the capital, was meant to comprise a quay 655 meters long for up to five ships and a holding area for 150,000 head of livestock. The ultimate objective of this component of the project was to create a livestock port with an anticipated capacity of 10 million heads of livestock per year that could export livestock from Ethiopia and South Sudan to the Gulf countries and North Africa. CCECC and CSCEC were the contractors responsible for project implementation.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on September 8, 2013. However, construction at the DMP did not begin until August 2014. Construction at the livestock port at Damerjog commenced on October 26, 2014. Construction activities ended in February 2017. The DMP was formally inaugurated on May 24, 2017 and then put into use in July 2018. This project has been plagued by controversy. In 2004, DP World acquired a 33.4-percent stake in the Doraleh Container Terminal SA (DCT). Then, on October 30, 2006, the Republic of Djibouti, DCT and Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE signed a concession agreement that granted Dubai International (Djibouti) FZE — a subsidiary of DP World — the exclusive right to design, build and manage the terminal. DCT commenced operations on December 15, 2008 (though it was formally inaugurated on February 7, 2009) as the first deep-water terminal in Africa that could permit ships of 15,000 TEU to dock alongside. However, the relationship between DP World and the Republic of Djibouti eventually deteriorated and the Republic of Djibouti initiated discussions with China about the possibility of developing a greenfield multi-purpose port adjacent to DCT. In early 2013, China Merchants Group and its affiliates agreed with Djibouti to develop, build, and operate a new multipurpose port, bulk terminal, crude oil terminal and ship repair yard in order to transform the old port of Djibouti. On February 5, 2013, CMPort’s wholly-owned subsidiary, China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE, acquired 23.5% equity stake in Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA) for $185 million to participate in the restructuring of the Port de Djibouti. However, DCT’s consent was never sought at any point in time prior to, or during, the construction and development phase of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port (DMP). Mr. Aboubaker Omar Hadi, Chairman, Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority (DPFZA), took the position that the Republic of Djibouti did not need to take DCT’s consent as the DMP was not an “additional” container handling facility, but a “replacement” for the Old Port.  DP World commenced arbitration proceedings against the Republic of Djibouti in the London Court of International Arbitration on July 8, 2014. The London Court of International Arbitration eventually found the Republic of Djibouti to be in breach of its agreement with DP World and issued a ruling on March 19, 2019 ordering it to pay $385.7 million (plus interest) as compensation to DP World.There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Phase 1 of Doraleh Multipurpose Port and the Damerjog Livestock Export Terminal Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.",Completion,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),Government of Djibouti,China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC)|China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)|Port De Djibouti S.A.,,"$406,755,069.80",11.5969097,43.0691988,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/480879281,precise

This loan consists of USD 50 million from the China Co-financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC), USD 147 million loan from the IDB itself, and the mobilization of USD 180 million in resources from other investors, including KfW DEG, a German financial institution and subsidiary of KfW; and Proparco, a French development finance institution. The IDB Invest portion had a 15 year maturity period, though the CHC loan borrowing terms are unknown.The IDB approval date for this loan financing was May 1, 2018, and it refers to this project with code 12177-01 and name 'Posorja Port.' The total investment of the first phase was estimated at USD 538 million as of April 26, 2019. The total cost of the project is expected to be USD 1.2 billion USD. The Guayaquil Port Authority (APG) helped with implementation of the project, and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) was one of the major project contractors. This deepwater port is a public private partnership (PPP) project, for which DP World Posorja received a 50 year concessionaire contract in May 2016. The port is located on the Guayas River, about 65 km from Guayaquil, and is expected to have a 750,000 TEU annual capacity.Construction for Phase I of the project began in July 2017. The port began operations in August 2019, though the final part of the first phase was finished in May 2020 with the arrival of four additional cranes. This first phase included, among other things, the creation of a 20 km service road to allow access to and from the port; the development of a multi-purpose terminal with 4 Quay Cranes, 15 rubber tyred gantry (RTGs), and a 400-meter pier; and the dredging of a deepwater access channel, 33.8 kilometers long (21 nautical miles), 16.5 meters deep, and 175 meters wide. This is the first deepwater port in Ecuador, intended to allow Post Panamax type vessels to maximize their cargo capacity. The port will additionally serve Neo Panamax and Triple E Class ships. The project's second phase is expected to consist of the development of a Special Economic Zone adjacent to the port, including a 1 square km logistics and industrial park.The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

In case of arrears on interest and principal, then the borrower is expected to pay interest on those arrears at an annualized rate equivalent to the interest rate on the respective loan plus one percent.' The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. SLPA (as the end-user) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to finance 85% of the cost of a $76.6 million commercial contract that its signed with China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (HQCEC) on June 13, 2008.China Eximbank disbursed an unknown amount in 2009, an unknown amount in 2010, $28.2 million in 2011, $3,339,025.80 in 2012, $1,099,631.65 in 2013, and $4,802,153.95 in 2014.

The bunkering facility and tank farm are located 1.2 km from the Hambantota waterfront, and are connected to the oil terminal through a pipeline. The facility has 14 tanks (total storage of 80,000 m3). Eight of these storage tanks carry bunker oil for ships and six of the storage tank tanks carry aviation fuel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This project was part of a broader effort by SLPA and the Government of Sri Lanka to position Hambantota port as a refueling and service point for cargo ships, which pass a few kilometers away off the southern tip of the country on one of the world’s busiest east-west shipping lanes. The contract for the Hambantota Bunkering Project was awarded to the China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation. Construction was started in October 2009 and its mechanical works were completed on October 10, 2011.Bunkering operations began after a project completion ceremony on June 22, 2014, and they are run by the SPLA. However, these operations were late suspended due to a loss of $19.9 million as a result of irregularities. 17,818 metric tons of marine gas oil were purchased by the Government of Sri Lanka for oil bunkering at the tank farm yard, but SLPA was only able to sell 3,235 metric tons due to the poor quality of oil. The Hambantota Bunkering Project has also encountered debt repayment problems.  On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions.

Kyaukpyu Deepwater Port,Myanmar,2018,67610,No,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Eximbank pledges loan to Government of Myanmar to finance its acquisition of 15% equity stake in Kyaukpyu Deepwater Port Project,"In 2009, Xi Jinping, as the Vice President of China, witnessed the signing of an MoU on the Kyauk Phyu Economic and Technological Development Zone, Deep Sea Port, Railway Projects in Myanmar. Then, on September 29, 2014, the Government of Myanmar issued an international tender for the development of the Kyauk Phyu Special Economic Zone (KPSEZ). On November 24, 2014, CITIC Group submitted tender documents for the Deep Sea Port (DSP) and the Industry Park (IP) Project of KPSEZ, respectively, to the Government of Myanmar. On December 30, 2015, the Government of Myanmar identify CITIC Group as the bid-winner of both the DSP Project and IP Project of KPSEZ.  On April 10, 2017, Myanmar's then President U Htin Kyaw and Chinese President Xi Jinping signed an exchange of letters regarding the implementation of the KPSEZ DSP Project and KPSEZ IP Project in KPSEZ. Then, on November 8, 2018, CITIC Group — on behalf of a larger consortium led by CITIC — and the KPSEZ Management Committee signed a $1.3 billion Framework Agreement of KPSEZ DSP Project. The Framework Agreement signing ceremony was held in Naypyidaw. [Note: In Chinese, the agreement is known as 缅甸皎漂经济特区深水港项目框架协议). According to the framework agreement, the deepwater port project was to be financed with 70% debt and 30% equity. Myanmar's Government would hold a 15% equity (ownership) stake in the project company (special purpose vehicle). Funding for Myanmar's equity contribution to the project (company) was expected come from a loan from Export-Import Bank of China.  Overall, 95% of the financing for the project was expected to come from China Eximbank, while 5% was expected to come from the Government of Myanmar (See: p. 38 of 'Myanmar Power Sector Financial Analysis and Viability Action Plan − Inception Report'). Then, on the occasion of Chinese President Xi Jinping's state visit to Myanmar on January 18, 2020, a set of transaction agreements — including the Shareholder Agreement and the Concession Agreement -- for the KPSEZ DSP Project were signed in the presence of Myanmar's State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and Chinese President Xi Jinping.  According to the agreements, the two sides agreed incorporate a Joint Venture (JV) to carry out the construction and operation of the KPSEZ DSP Project. Eight months later, on August 6, 2020, Myanmar’s Directorate of Investment and Company Administration approved the registration of the project company (joint venture/special purpose vehicle), which is known as Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd (ရေနက်ဆိပ်ကမ်းစီမံကိန်းဖက်စပ်ကုမ္ပဏီကို). Several months later, in November 2020, the KPSEZ Management Committee and the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd — a joint venture of CITIC Myanmar Port Investment Limited  (70% equity stake) and the Government of Myanmar’s KPSEZ Management Committee (KP SEZ Management Committee) (30% equity stake) — signed a Concession Agreement. Under the terms of the Concession Agreement, Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd agreed to undertake the project according to a design-build-finance-operate-maintain-transfer (DBFOMT) model. A coup d'état in Myanmar began on the morning of February 1, 2021, when democratically elected members of the country's ruling party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), were deposed by the Tatmadaw—Myanmar's military—which then vested power in a military junta. Acting president Myint Swe proclaimed a year-long state of emergency and declared power had been transferred to Commander-in-Chief of Defence Services Min Aung Hlaing. It declared the results of the November 2020 general election invalid and stated its intent to hold a new election at the end of the state of emergency. Then. on May 3, 2021, Myanmar’s Military Council reconstituted the KP SEZ Management Committee. The Committee was chaired by U Myint Thein, retired Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Railways. U San Shwe Maung, a member of the Rakhine State Planning and Administration Council, joined the Department of Urban and Housing Development as the vice chairman. Ministry of Economy and Commerce Ministry of Planning and Finance Kyauk Phyu District General Administration Department officials, Including officials from Myanmar Port Authority (Rakhain State). Nearly three months later, on July 29, 2021, a tender was announced to hire a company to provide legal advice to the KP SEZ Management Committee (the Government of Myanmar’s representative on the Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co. Ltd). CITIC Myanmar Company subsequently announced that CITIC Construction and CCCC FHDI, a joint venture team, won the bid to carry out the preliminary field investigation and consultancy work required for the construction process of the project. CCCC FHDI is a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The signing ceremony of the agreement to carry out the work was held in Beijing on September 15, 2021. Then, on January 24, 2022, Daw Aye Nu Sein, a member of the Military Council, visited the Kyauk Phyu Deep Sea Port and Special Economic Zone Project site. In addition, during the meeting of the Military Council's Central Working Group on the Myanmar Economic Zone, the Chairman of the Economic Zone, Dr. Pwong San, said that the Kyauk Phyu DSP Project need to be implemented quickly because local residents would get employment opportunities and other economic benefits. In February 2022, after a year-long international public tendering and evaluation process, the consortium led by CITIC selected MSR Consortium as the Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) service consultant. Then, on June 29, 2022, the Central Bank of Myanmar (“CBM”) issued the Letter No. FE-1/643 for exemption of the foreign currency conversion requirements under the CBM Notification No. 12/2022 to exclude the following entities from the foreign currency conversion requirement:  Kyaukphyu Special Economic Zone Project Development Company Ltd. and yaukphyu Special Economic Zone Deep Seaport Co.

(75% equity stake) that is itself jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (52.50% equity stake) and Tolaram (22.5% equity stake), Lagos State Government (20% equity stake), and the Nigerian Ports Authority (5% equity stake) — signed a concession agreement for the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. LPLEL was awarded a 45-year concession on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis. It is responsible, under the terms of the concession agreement to develop, finance, build, operate and, at the end of the concession term, transferring the Lekki Deep Water Port (located in the Lagos Free Trade Zone) to NPA. LPLEL will earn revenues through operations of the port. Upon completion, Lekki Port is expected to have a total of 3 container berths, 1 dry bulk berth and 3 liquid berths. The port is projected to have the capacity to handle about 5.5 million containers and estimated to generate 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the economy. It is also expected to generate over $361 billion over the 45-year concession period with the Government of Nigeria earning about $200 billion. CMA Terminals Nigeria, a subsidiary of French shipping company CMA CGM, which it jointly owns with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), will operate the port once it opens in 2022, following the signing of a sub-concession agreement on September 30, 2019.  On October 23, 2019, China Development Bank (CDB) and LPLEL signed a long-term, $629 million commercial loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#85628) were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $679 million commercial (EPC) contract with CHEC, which was signed on May 11, 2012. On the same day, CDB and Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited signed a Sponsor Support Agreement, Completion Guarantee Agreement and the Tripartite Keep well Agreement as well as seven security documents. The total cost of Phase 1 is $1.043 billion. CHEC made a $221,047,248 direct equity investment in Phase 1 of the project on March 30, 2020 (captured via Project ID#87054).

Additional debt financing was reportedly provided by Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), European Investment Bank, FMO, IFC, African Finance Corporation, DEG, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, and Stanbic Bank. CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 29, 2018. Phase 1 construction activities commenced on June 15, 2020. Then, in October 2020, construction of a 680 meter long quay wall commenced, with the driving of the first sets of piles underway. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at the project site, the Chief Executive Officer of Lekki Port, Mr. Ruogang Du, said that the commencement of piling of the quay wall, which is a major phase of the construction, symbolized a significant step towards the timely delivery of the project. In late November 2020, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation directed Dr. Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, and the legal department to document an agreement with the Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Ltd., to ensure that the port becomes operational in 2022. The Minister of Transportation gave this directive while inspecting the project.  In late March 2021, it was announced that the project had achieved a 48% completion rate and would begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2023. In early May 2021, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited announced that construction of the Lekki Deep Seaport had reached a nearly 50% completion rate. At that time, the 1,909 meter long core of the main breakwater was completed, and work on the quay wall and landside infrastructure has reached advanced stages.

Lomé Container Terminal,Togo,2011,64343,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Development Bank provides a $46.64 million USD loan for the Lomé Container Terminal Project,"In December 2011, Togo’s Ministry of Transport and Ministry of Economy and Finance awarded a project company and special purpose vehicle called Lomé Container Terminal S.A. (LCT) a 35-year concession agreement (franchise agreement) — with an optional 10-year extension — to develop, construct and operate a greenfield transshipment container terminal within the Port of Lomé (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...').LCT was established in December 2008 and it is indirectly wholly owned by Thesar Maritime Limited (TML), which is a joint venture between Global Terminal Limited (GTL) and Oasis King International Limited (OKI). GTL is wholly owned by Terminal Investment Limited (TIL), while OKI is 70% indirectly owned by China Merchants Holding International (CMHI) and 30% owned by the China Africa Development Fund (CADF), a wholly owned company of China Development Bank (CDB). TIL is a subsidiary of the Italian-Swiss shipowner Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) (see 'The China Merchants in Djibouti...').[Note: In August 2012, CMHI through its wholly-owned subsidiary OKL acquired a 50% stake in Thesar Maritime Limited (see '招商局国际收购西非多哥集装箱码头50%股份'). TIL merged with GTL in a reorganization in December 2012; the shareholders of TML (and LCT, by extension) at that time were CMHI and TIL on an equal (50/50) basis (see '多哥 洛美集装箱码头'). CMHI later transferred 30% stake of OKI to the CADF; as a result, CMHI’s effective interest in TML was 35% as of December 31, 2017 (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...).] According to the World Bank in 2011, the Lomé Container Terminal Project cost $442 million USD and was financed according to 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. In 2011, LCT signed a $331.5 million USD lending agreement with a group of banks for the project — including the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), German Investment and Development Corporation (DEG), and China Development Bank (CDB) — for the Lomé Container Terminal Project. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) was the sole lead arranger of the debt package (see 'Lome Container Terminal, Togo'). CDB provided a $46.64 million USD loan for the project; however, the borrowing terms of its loan are unknown (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal'). The breakdown of the debt package for the rest of Lomé Container Terminal Project was as follows: the IFC provided a loan of $116 million USD; the African Development Bank (AfDB) provided a loan of $75.56 million USD; Germany's KfW provided a loan of $46.64 million USD (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal'). The remaining $110.5 million was provided via equity contributions from the Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) (see 'World Bank Infrastructure Finance Report: Lome Container Terminal').However, there were several other financiers for the project unreported by the World Bank. The OPEC Fund for International Development (OFID) provided €30 million EUR (€20 million in 2012, €10 million in 2015) for the project (see 'OFID signs new financing agreement for Togo’s Lomé Container Terminal'). The Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO) provided €35 million EUR (€25 million in 2011, €10 million in 2015) for the project (see 'LOME CONTAINER TERMINAL SA'). Proparco provided a €30 million EUR loan for the project in 2011 (see 'LOAN TO LCT TO BUILD A CONTAINER TERMINAL...').The purpose of this project was to construct three berths — that have a total coastline of 1,050 meters, a water depth of 16.6 meters, and an area of 53 hectares — at the Port of Lomé. Upon completion, the container terminal was expected to have an annual handling capacity of 2.2 million 20-feet container units (TEU) (see '招商局港口多哥洛美港项目推介'). The terminal was designed to accommodate container cargo ships 16.6 m over Panamax size (see pg.4-5 of 'The Project for The Study on Togo Logistics Corridor Development'). The planned maximum vessel size that the port could accommodate was 14,000 TEU (see 'Port of Lomé Togo').The Port of Lomé was one of the few deep-water ports in Western and Central Africa; it served as a shipment hub towards land-locked Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso, as well as northern Nigeria. The port had an existing capacity of 221,000 TEU on the West African coast because of its ideal location. It also served as a gateway to landlocked Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso, as well as the northern parts of Nigeria. The port’s existing capacity was 221,000 container units; the project, by seeking to expand it, was addressing growing Togolese needs and regional demand for more trade (see 'Boosting Regional Integration and Trade in West Africa...').The Khouri Group Ltd. received a $250 million USD contract to construct a 300 meter sand barrier, clear the existing landscape, and bank the area with sand with a thickness of about 2,00 meters, compact the terminal surface, build dock walls and foundations for gantries and cranes, open the main jetty at depth and dredge the harbor basin, create a storage area for hazardous material, and construct buildings, fences, electric lines, and a road, rail, and waterways network (see 'New Construction: State of the art Harbor; Lomé, TOGO'). Finnish company Konecranes Oyj provided a 22 16-wheel electric rubber tyred gantry (RTG) cranes, with a lifting capacity of 40 tons, for the container terminal (see 'More Konecranes RTGs to Port of Lomé, Togo'). Spanish company Humiclima S.A. was responsible for the installation of the ventilation, air conditioning, plumbing, sewage, and fire systems in the terminal's administrative, customs, and goods receipt offices (see 'LOME CONTAINER TERMINAL'). German company RMT Industrie- und Elektrotechnik GmbH was responsible for the installation of the design, provision, and installation of the electrical equipment - emergency generators, MV and LV electricity supply, and lighting and communications equipment - for the terminal (see 'OUR PROJECTS').Project Management International (PMI Ltd.) was contracted by LCT to conduct marine, offshore geotechnical, onshore geotechnical, and marine condition surveys for the project (see 'Lomé Container Terminal GSI'). Staff of Spanish company Ingeomar S.L.P. acted as technical advisors during construction {{see Source ID#123510}}. RBS EMEA UG was contracted to provide its terminal operating system (TOPS) suite, a web frontend, and a KPI tool for the management of the container terminal (see 'Selected Success Stories'). Togo's Ministry of Public Works and Transport (now the Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport) supervised the project, while the Autonomous Port of Lomé was responsible for the implementation of construction projects and operation of port infrastructures at the port (see pg.6 of 'Executive Summary of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment...').MSC, which has a 12% share of the international container shipping market, was expected to serve as LCT’s “anchor customer.' (see 'Boosting Regional Integration and Trade in West Africa...').  LCT was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction was underway some time before January 23, 2014 (see '胡平参赞走访洛美集装箱码头项目'). LCT put the port into trial operation on October 23, 2014, although some construction continued beyond this point (see '多哥 洛美集装箱码头'). Most construction had been completed by December 2015 (see '招商局港口多哥洛美港项目推介'). All construction was eventually completed (see pg.5 of 'Assessing the Risks of Chinese Investments in Sub-Saharan African Ports'). The port was jointly operated by TIL and CMHI (see pg.5 of 'CAO ASSESSMENT REPORT...'). The container terminal was a boon to the Port of Lomé, which saw an increase the number of containers transiting the port, as of December 31, 2017, container throughput handled by LCT was 0.89 million TEUs compared to 0.53 million TEUs in 31 December 2016, a year-on-year increase of 67.5%. As a result, the Port of Lomé over took the Port of Lagos as the leading port in West Africa (see 'Lomé’s port becomes West Africa’s leading container port, overtaking Lagos’').

Mangapwani Multipurpose Port,Tanzania,2013,30937,No,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Eximbank pledges $200 million USD concessional loan for the Zanzibar New Port Project,"In March 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Zanzibar signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for a potential $200 million USD concessional loan for the Zanzibar New Port Project (or Maruhubi Multipurpose Port Project or Mpiga Duri Port or Port of Malindi or 桑岛新港 or 桑新集散港). According to Moguldom Nation, the loan wielded a 25-year maturity and 5-year grace period. It is unclear whether the two sides ever signed a final financing agreement for this project. As of February 2018, the Government of Zanzibar was still negotiating with China Eximbank for this loan facility. In June 2019, the Daily News reported that Zanzibar's Minister of Infrastructure, Communication, and Transport said negotiations with China Exim Bank had stalled and therefore the Government of Tanzania would use its own funds to support this project. On the other hand, according to a 2019 report from the World Bank, construction was ongoing with financing from China Exim Bank. A November 2020 article from The Citizen suggests that Zanzibar was completely starting over on this project and a January 2021 article from the same source describes a similar multipurpose port project now being implementing with Oman. Therefore it is unclear whether a final financing agreement with China Eximbank was ever signed. In addition to $200 million of debt financing from China Eximbank, China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) signed an agreement pledging to provide another $30 million USD of equity financing on the condition that 13% of port shares will be lent back to CHEC after the completion of the project. CHEC signed the 36-month EPC contract on 21 February 2014. However, the project encountered various delays that had delayed implementation. The purpose of this project aims to boost trade by constructing a new harbor in the Maruhubi area of Zanzibar. The port of Zanzibar is managed, operated and developed by the Zanzibar Ports Corporation (ZPC), a parastatal organization regulated by the Zanzibar Maritime Authority (ZMA). With approximately 1.5 million passengers per year, Malindi has one of the busiest passenger terminals in the East African region. However, the port was severely congested and dated so the 2007 Zanzibar Transport Master Plan created the Zanzibar New Port Project to solve those issues.

The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial contract between the Ministry of Infrastructure and Utilities of the Republic of Vanuatu and Shanghai Construction Group (SCG) Co., Ltd, which was signed on December 24, 2013. The purpose of the project was to extend and rehabilitate the main wharf in Port Luganville. Prior to the implementation of the project, the main wharf — measuring 270 meters in length — could handle close to 100,000 tons of freight annually. However, it was insufficient for providing full service for all cargo served and tourist boat arrivals due to wharf berth space availability. In addition, new businesses that require the ability to transfer certain heavy cargo off large vessels and into trucks could not be served, due to the physical conditions of the wharf. A key objective of the project was to lengthen the existing wharf (east towards Samanson wharf) and thereby establish a berth with a total length of 361 meters. The main wharf at Port Luganville is accessible to existing tarsal roads and located around 1 kilometer from Luganville town. Copra, Cocoa, Kava, Coconut oil and coconut mills are the primary commodities received and shipped at the port, but it also provides specialty services on-demand to local business located within Sanma Province and other customers. Upon completion, the project was expected to give the main wharf in Port Luganville the capacity to dock two DWT freighters or 1 GT cruise. It was also expected to generate a 15% increase in outbound and inbound traffic. SCG was the contractor responsible for implementation. The originally expected project implementation period was June 2014-June 2017. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 9, 2015. However, construction did not begin until July 28, 2015. The final handover ceremony for the project was conducted on August 19, 2017, and the Luganville Wharf went into operation by the 2017.

Port of Ashdod,Israel,2014,65483,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),2014,0,China Eximbank provides buyer’s credit loan for Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project,"In June 2014, it was announced that Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company (PMEC) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company - won a tender to build the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal (נמל הדרום) in Israel with a 3.35 billion NIS bid. The port, one of Israel's largest, was located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. An Israeli state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Israel Ports & Assets Company Ltd., was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project and eventually assuming responsibility for the property and assets constructed by PMEC.The Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) identifies this project on its website in a long list of of other projects that it is financing with loans. However, it is not clear when China Eximbank issued a loan for this project. The face value, borrower, and borrowing terms of the loan are also unknown. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) did issue buyer’s credit insurance for up to $948 million to the borrower. According to the Chinese Government, the monetary value of the commercial contract for the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project was approximately $950 million (with a total contract period is 93 months).The port was developed under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) process as part of a 25-year concession. The port's eventual operator  was to complete the terminal development and then equip, operate, and maintain the port for the duration of the contract period. The project was divided into three subprojects: the breakwater project, the dredging project, and the wharf project. More specifically, the project involved the construction of a wharf with a total shoreline length of 2,363 meters project. It also involved the building of an 800-meter long main quay with a water depth of 17.3m, an extension of the port’s existing main breakwater by 600 meters, the building of 1,500 meters of secondary breakwaters, the dredging of the port, and the construction of storage and operating spaces.Upon completion, it was expected that the southern terminal would the capacity to handle 1 to 2.16 million TEU (20-foot standard containers) annually. The facilities were built on reclaimed land, and were planned to handle Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) 18,000+ TEU vessels.The port was one of the biggest investment projects in Israel, as well as one of the largest harbor construction projects contracted to a Chinese company. The southern terminal was to be Israel's first privatized port and was expected to connect Israel with international trade routes between Asia and Europe. 90% of Israeli international trade went through its seaports, but Israel lacked the capacity to handle the largest vessels; the new port was designed to accommodate these larger ships. Moreover, the new port was expected to be more competitive and efficient than Israel's existing state-controlled ports in Ashdod and Haifa. Overall, the port was expected to improve Israel's economic development and trade, as well as herald in a new era of Sino-Israeli cooperation. In addition to PMEC, China Communications Second Navigation Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd. was subcontracted to support the project implementation. Chinese state-owned construction machinery company Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd. (XCMG) provided a 800t XGC800 crawler crane, as well as other construction equipment for hosting ripraps and Antifer-blocks (concrete blocks to guard against waves) for project implementation.The cornerstone for the seaport was laid on October 28, 2014, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. At the time, the port was expected to begin operations in 2021. Despite reports from Chinese sources that the project faced challenges in hydraulic engineering, the adoption of European, American, and Israeli standards, the local climate, the environmental impact, noise concerns from local residents, as well as its expansive scale. Nonetheless, CHEC-PMEC made good progress by innovating, including independently developing the world's first platform jackup rig specifically designed for offshore gravel pile construction. As of July 2019, the project was still expected to be completed in 2021. The port was still ongoing as of April 2021. However, in 2022, the main part of the reconstruction project of Pier 21 in Ashdod Port, Israel, undertaken by Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Company, was completed ahead of schedule and put into operation.Dutch firm Terminal Investment Limited, a subsidiary of the Swiss firm Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC), won the Israeli government tender to operate the Ashdod’s Southern Terminal for 25 years following the completion of its construction.",Implementation,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Vague,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Pan-Mediterranean Engineering Corporation,"China Communications Second Navigation Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd.|Israel Ports & Assets Company Ltd.|Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd.

Port of Banjul,Gambia,2017,56668,No,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,China Eximbank pledges $177 million government concessional loan for Banjul Port Extension Project,"In its 2015 Financial Statement and Annual Report, the Gambia Ports Authority (GPA) disclosed that it had signed an MOU with China Harbour and Engineering Corporation (CHEC) regarding the Banjul Port Extension Project and it intended to apply for a China Eximbank loan to finance this project. Then, on October 2, 2017, the Government of the Gambia’s Finance and Economic Affairs Minister Amadou Sanneh submitted an application to China Eximbank for a $177,077,885 government concessional loan (GCL) to support Banjul Port Extension Project. The proposed borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The proceeds of the loan would be used to finance 100% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The Banjul Port Extension Project, if implemented, would install a new jetty, an approach bridge, channel dredging, maintenance of the dredging rehabilitation container terminal, a head office for use of the port authority, and repairs to the Banjul wharf. However, this project has been plagued by domestic controversy and it does not appear that a loan agreement with China Eximbank has been finalized. The Gambian Ministry of Justice questioned the legality of the Government of the Gambia’s contract with CRBC because it was issued without following standard competitive bidding procedures. Another concern that arose was the fact that a feasibility study for the project that was carried out by CRBC and it put the cost of the project at $123,697,885.77, yet the cost of the CRBC contract identified in the government’s loan application to China Eximbank was $177,077,885. This discrepancy of $53,380,000 prompted allegations that the contract price was artificially inflated. Then, on June 4, 2018, the Gambian Works Minister, Bai Lamin Jobe, convened a meeting with Secretary General, Habib Drammeh, GPA Board Chairman, Alpha Barry, MD, GPA, Abdoulie Tambadou and Permanent Secretary of Works, Mariama Ndure-Njie to discuss how the EPC contract with CRBC. At this meeting, the Gambian Works Minister reportedly decided not address four issues related to the EPC contract that were by flagged by external consultants (GAMWORKS and NIRAS Consulting Engineers of Denmark) but rejected by CBRC: concerns about the $177 million face value of the China Eximbank loan, the establishment of unit prices/rates after the completion of detailed project design work, the absence of a value-for-money analysis, and GPA requirements. The Gambia’s Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Lamin Camara, also raised concerns with the Works Minister, Secretary General and the GPA Board Chairman, noting in email correspondence that ‘I MUST say once again that the country is not in position to absorb such a loan facility as it will eventually take us to a very serious level of debt unsustainability and would eventually make us miss our programs with the [IMF] and the [World Bank] and that may ultimately affect the gains we achieved in the Barrow government.’ He also warned that the ‘[China Eximbank] loan facility comprises of one fifth of the whole public debt of the country so there is no way it can be financed given the current situation’.",Pipeline: Pledge,Commercial,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Government of Gambia,"China Communications Construction Co., Ltd.

The financing package consisted of a 13-year A loan from the World Bank's International Finance Corporation ( IFC), a 13-year B loan from Costa Rica's regional infrastructure financing corporation CIFI, and two 10-year loans from banks Banco Espirito Santo and WestLB. IFC and the Central American Mezzanine Infrastructure Fund (CAMIF) also provided a joint 10.5-year C loan.The first phase of the $224 million project involved the construction of a new international container terminal — including a 440 meter berth, two ship-to-shore gantry cranes, seven rubber-tired gantry cranes (RTGs) and ancillary facilities — in the Port City of Buenaventura at the Aguacate Marsh before the Cascajal Island. The container terminal is located in Buenaventura’s urban area, 2.4 kilometers away from the existing terminal of Sociedad Portuaria Regional de Buenaventura. Upon completion, the terminal was expected to provide approximately 268,000 twenty foot equivalent units (“TEUs”) in operational capacity and only handle containers.Then, in 2014, TCBuen secured a second financing package for the second phase of the project. The total cost of Phase 2 was $157.9 million and it was financed in part with a $25 million A loan from the IFC and a $65 million B loan from a syndicate of banks. The purpose of Phase 2 was to expand and modernize the Port of Buenaventura and increase its capacity to 610,000 TEUs. Then, in 2018, TCBuen signed a $140 million syndicated secured term loan facility agreement with four banks — Banco Santander, SA; Bank of China (Luxembourg) SA Stockholm Branch; Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited Seoul Branch; and Banco Sabadell SA, Miami Branch — to refinance its existing debts from the project’s construction phase (Phase 1).Construction of the container terminal began in August 2008. Maritime operations began on January 27, 2011. The expansion of the terminal began in 2014. This project has been a subject of local controversy.

The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided an export credit insurance policy for the facility and Eximbank provided 85% of the premium. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance up to 85% of the price of a commercial contract between Caioporto, S.A. and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).Caioporto, S.A. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established and owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) for the financing, construction and management of a deep-water commercial port in the village of Caio within Cabinda Province.  The only equity in this project was provided by a $180 million investment from Angola's Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) and an unknown investment amount by Quantum Global Group, an investment group founded by Swiss-Angolan Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais.The Port of Caio Construction Project is being implemented in multiple phases.  The first phase involves the construction a 630 meter seaport wall, a 2 km bridge and access pier to the seaport terminal with 2km length, a 180 meter access channel, and a 200 meter-wide, 14 meter-deep docking basin.  The second phase involves the construction of a 200 meter-wide, 18 meter-deep access channel and a docking pier that is 1,130 meters long and 16 meters deep with the capacity to dock 4 large ships simultaneously and welcome some of the world’s largest ships.  Upon completion, the port will have the capacity to move about 60 containers per hour.

Then, on April 15, 2010, the Tanzania Port Authority and CCCC signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for a feasibility study. It was carried out in May 2010 and established a scope of work for the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal Expansion Project (or Dar es Salaam Harbor Upgrade Project). This project would involve the construction of two more berths (13 and 14), the dredging of an entrance channel, and the creation of a container stacking yard to better handle container traffic. The Government of Tanzania subsequently submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.Circa 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China agreed — at least in principle — to issue a $587.35 million concessional loan to the Government of Tanzania for the Dar es Salaam Container Terminal Expansion Project. The borrowing terms of the loan included a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity.

The Government of Tanzania would be responsible for finance the remaining 15%.However, in 2013, the CCCC contract was cancelled on overpricing grounds and a Congolese company known as Impala Africa was selected as the new contractor responsible for project implementation. Ephraim Mgawe, Director General of the TPA, was later sentenced to five years imprisonment in January 2017 for the fraudulent awarding of the Dar es Salaam Harbor Upgrade Project to the China Communications Construction Company, Ltd, in order to secure a China Eximbank loan. CCCC later brought litigation against the Tanzania Port Authority over the contract.

On January 17, 2020, China State Construction Engineering Corporation, China Harbour Engineering Company and Algeria’s state-run Port Services Group formed a joint venture to implement the project.Then, on June 29, 2020, the President of Algeria instructed the country’s Prime Minister to ‘make new contact with the Chinese partner and study the project on new transparent bases in order to submit it for the second time to the Council of Ministers, within a maximum period of three months.’ In November 2020, Algeria’s Finance Minister announced that the El Hamdania Deepwater Container Port Infrastructure Project would commence in early 2021. Then, on March 14, 2021, Mr. Amar Grine, was appointed as Director General of the National Agency for Construction of Cherchell Port (Agence Nationale de Réalisation Port Centre de CHERCHELL or ANRPCC). Seven days later, on March 22, 2021, it was reported that construction would begin in May 2021 and take four years to complete (May 2025). Then, in December 2021, Amar Grine announced that the project was being rescoped and he expected the cost to be downwardly revised.The purpose of the project is to construct a deepwater container port in the village of El Hamdania within Cherchell district (the so-called Central new Port of Algeria). Upon completion, the port is expected to have 23 docks capable of processing 6.5 million 2-foot containers and 26 million tons of goods per year. It is also expected to be managed and operated by China’s Shanghai International Port Group for 25 years under a concession agreement.",Pipeline: Pledge,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Vague,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,"Joint Venture of SERPORT, CSCEC, and CHEC","China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.|China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC)|Groupe SERPORT|Shanghai International Port Group (SIPG)",,"$3,716,290,556.00",36.6268528,2.2734442,,approximate location
Port of Goubet,Djibouti,2012,30346,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),2013,2017,China Eximbank provides RMB 426 million government concessional loan for Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet,"On November 11, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Djibouti signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. Then, on November 19, 2012, China Eximbank and Djibouti’s Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 426,000,000 (FDJ 11,400,000,000/$63,998,908) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet. The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: a 7.5-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 2.5% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the GCL (loan) had achieved a 20.8% disbursement rate as of 2014 ($13,354,884 out of $63,998,908) and it ultimately achieved a 82.4% disbursement rate (FDJ 9,388,000,000 out of FDJ 11,400,000,000).The cargo facility at the Port of Goubet was designed to facilitate the export of salt and gypsum deposits from Lake Assal, the world’s largest undeveloped salt reserve and the second most saline body of water on Earth after Don Juan Pond in Antarctica. This project sought to create a port with a depth of 14 meters, and a terminal bulk carrier located 17 meters from the extraction zone. The project also involved the rehabilitation of a 8.4 km road connecting the terminal to the extraction zone. The Port of Goubet is located 40 km south of the Gulf of Goubet, and its construction was designed to help Djibouti export 5 million tons of salt annually to Southeast Asian countries. China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd., a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Ltd., was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 7, 2013, and the President of Djibouti inaugurated the mineral port on June 22, 2017.  The completion of this project paved the way for a longer-term commercial investment by China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. and China Communications Construction Company Ltd.. In 2015, CCCC Resource — a joint venture of Overseas Business Department of China Communications Construction Company Ltd. and China Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. — purchased a 65% equity stake in Djibouti Salt Investment Company (吉布提鹽業投資公司 or SIS). Then, on August 22, 2017, the Government of Djibouti and Djibouti Salt Investment Company signed a concession agreement, which granted Djibouti Salt Investment Company the exclusive rights to develop and extract salt and bromine resources from Lake (Lac) Assal and develop a salt chemical (sodium bromide) industrial park for 50 years. Lake Assal reportedly contains around 2 billion tons of salt minerals that had previously been harvested only in small quantities through traditional methods.There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Djibouti Assal Lake Salt Export Terminal Project at the Port of Goubet may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million in March 2020. Then, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.",Completion,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,ODA-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank),,Djiboutian Ministry of Economy and Finance,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.

Port of Manzanillo,Mexico,2015,85355,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,[China Co-Financing Fund] IDB administers 25 million USD loan from CHC to Contecon Manzanillo for Container Port and Logistics Facility,"On 21 October 2015, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) signed a loan contract with Contecon Manzanillo to finance a Container Port and Logistics Facility, through which the IDB would provide 65 million USD from its ordinary capital (Loan 3348A/OC-ME-1, Loan 3348A/OC-ME-2), and the People's Bank of China would provide 25 million USD (Loan 3348/CH-ME-1, Loan 3348/CH-ME-2) via the China Co-Financing Fund for Latin America and the Caribbean (CHC). The IDB would also administer a B loan, which would be financed by other commercial banks or financial institutions (Loan 3348B/OC-ME).The IDB approval date for this loan financing was 19 November 2014,  and it refers to this project as 'ME-L1152 : Contecon Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility'.This project would involve the expansion of the pre-existing Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility, located in the State of Colima, Mexico. The loan financing went to the development of infrastructure to help increase the port's capacity by 1.35 million TEU annually by 2021. It is also intended to directly contribute to the Government of Mexico’s Plan Nacional de Desarrollo 2013-2018.The specific portions of the container port and logistics facility that the China Co-Financing Fund and IDB ordinary capital loans went towards were yard development, additional ship-to-shore cranes and all related yard equipment, ground slots, intermodal facilities, other related infrastructure, and all indirect costs related to the financing itself (Project Overview). The IDB also offered the project technical support. The loan recipient, Contecton Manzanillo, is a special purpose vehicle created for the purpose of creating the container port and logistics facility and is a subsidiary of  International Container Terminal Services Inc. (ICTSI). ICTSI is a private port management and development company headquartered in the Philippines and was awarded a 34 year concession contract for the development and operation of the Manzanillo Container Port and Logistics Facility by the Mexican Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transporte, SCT), through the Manzanillo Port Administration (Administración Portuaria Integral de Manzanillo S.A. de C.V.) in January 2010.Terminal construction for the original Container Port and Logistics Facility, which was expanded upon by this project, began in December 2010, and on August 5, 2013, the first vehicle was received for operation (per the Contecon Manzanillo website). Construction was 90 percent complete and the project was operating at a 10 percent capacity in October 2013, per the Environmental and Social Management Report (ESMR) from the IDB. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) was the primary contractor on the initial construction of the Container Port and Logistics Facility, but it is unclear if they were involved in the parts of the project funded by the China Co-Financing Fund and other IDB loan. In October 2019, two gantry cranes and five rubber tire gantries (RTG) were delivered to the port, likely funded through this project.In addition to the IDB ordinary capital loan, other co-financiers for the program included the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which loaned 65 million USD; the German development bank KfW, which loaned 52.5 million USD; and Standard Chartered Bank (see the World Bank PPI database entry and 'IDB supports improvements to Mexico’s largest port'). The total project cost was estimated to be about 567 million USD, as of October 2015 (see 'IDB supports improvements to Mexico’s largest port').The China Co-Financing Fund was established on 14 January 2013 with a contribution of 2 billion USD by the People's Bank of China, and it is administered by the IDB.

This loan carries a maturity of 14 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. The interest rate is calculated using the average 6-month LIBOR of 1.626% from November 2017 plus 190 basis points = 3.526%. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) reportedly contributed $200 million to this loan syndicate. Other funders were Mizuho Bank, Ltd., the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), African Development Bank and other eight private financial institutions. The purpose of the project is to construct the railway and port infrastructure that is needed to transport and export coal produced from the Moatize coal mine in Mozambique. It involves the construction of a 912 km railway that connects the Moatize coal mine developed by Vale S.A. and Mitsui & Co, Ltd. in Tete to the port of Nacala through part of Malawi. The railway has three sections: (1) the Nacala-to-Velha section that connects the village of Andre Mossuril to the town of Nacala-a-Velha; (2) the Lumbo section that connects the city of Monapo to the port village of Lumbo; and (3) the Cuamba-Lichinga section that connects the town of Cuamba to the city of Lichinga.

(20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016. CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069). The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom. Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt. The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements.

Port of Sabetta,Russia,2016,67041,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),2012,2018,"China Eximbank provides RMB 4.472 billion loan for Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project (Linked to Project ID#67064, #67062, #67063, and #67040)","In April 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and China Eximbank signed a syndicated loan facility with OAO Yamal LNG (or JSC Yamal LNG or ОАО 'Ямал СПГ') — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Russia’s OAO NOVATEK (50.1% ownership stake), France's Total S.A. (20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016. CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67063) was worth RMB 5,286,000,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. China Eximbank provided both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67062) was worth EUR 4,279,700,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years. In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069). The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom. Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt. The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan.

Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom. Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt. The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions.

Its maturity length was 15 years. In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069). The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

Then, on November 11, 2014, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda submitted a project proposal and application for a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Antigua. On December 22, 2014, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed an RMB 1,590,000,000 commercial (‘design and construction’) contract (#AB/PMP-01) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on May 25, 2015, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed a revised commercial contract (#AB/PMP-02) worth RMB 585,000,000.

Less than a month later, on December 15, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a framework agreement for a RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 21.75 years. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 19, 2038. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance the RMB 585,000,000 commercial contract that was signed on May 25, 2015. The remaining RMB 15,000,000 was to be used by the borrower to finance a contract with Guangxi Bagui Project Supervision and Consultant Co. Ltd for project management and supervision activities related to the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The borrower also agreed to deposit the operating income generated by the project in an escrow account to support debt service requirements. The purpose of the project is to bring about the long-awaited transformation of the St. John’s Port from a break-bulk facility to a modern container port facility that is capable of increasing annual cargo throughput from 16,000 containers to 80,000 containers. It involves the construction of a new Customs and Port Authority headquarters, the expansion of a quay (extension of the existing pier), the construction of a new warehouse for processing goods, the extension of a sea wall, the dredging of the harbor, and the establishment of a logistics park. Some of the expected project benefits include improved ship-to-shore interface; greater efficiency in the clearance of goods; automated scanning and computerized handling/clearance of goods; reduced ground transportation costs, and greater ease of doing business. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 15, 2018. However, the project did not commence until September 8, 2018. It was originally envisaged that the project would take three years to implement.  Satellite imagery suggests that, as of July 2020, a 320-meter quay expansion and the construction of a new warehouse were complete (or nearly completed).  Satellite imagery from July 2020 also suggests that, on the northern side of the port, land had been built up for what is likely the new sea wall and a set of buildings and a parking lot had been constructed, while another pier to the south was being added to the existing cruise terminal.

The project is being implemented in two phases. Phase 1 involves the dredging of the access channel, the extension of the breakwater northward by 1.75 kilometers (to reduce the intensity of wave action inshore), the construction of bulk oil service terminal, the construction of quay walls, the reclamation of a land area of 53,000 hectares, the installation of new security and fire service posts, the installation of new entry and exit gates, and the construction of an access road to the port and a new bridge over the existing railway line and reclamation works. Phase 2 involves involves the development of physical infrastructure within the port, including the construction of good road network in and out of the port and the construction of a container terminal in Sekondi. Upon completion, it is expected that the TPEP will position Takoradi Port as a petroleum hub providing services for offshore operations in Ghana and the West African sub-region. On August 31, 2012, China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) signed a $150 million commercial (EPC) contract with Ghana Ports and Harbours Authority (GPHA) for the implementation of the first phase of the project. At the time, GPHA and CHEC announced that Phase 1 would be supported by a commercial loan from China Development Bank. However, when Phase 1 commenced in September 2013, GPHA had apparently replaced CHEC with a Belgium company called Jan De Nul. While China Development Bank reportedly agreed in principle to finance this project with a loan, there is no evidence that this pledge resulted in official loan commitment. Also, while it was originally envisaged that the second phase of the project would financed through the $3 billion master facility agreement that the Government of Ghana signed with CDB in 2011, this plan did not come to fruition (see #2034).",Pipeline: Pledge,Development,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Vague,Vague (Official Finance),China Development Bank (CDB),,Government of Ghana,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.",,$0.00,4.88707333,-1.7351962,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/756865759,boundary not clear

In July 2017, CCCC signed an investment agreement with WPR Participações (a Brazilian firm and subsidiary of WTorre Group) for building the terminal. Then, on March 16, 2018, ICBC, represented by ICBC Brazil, signed a financing mandate letter committing to provide a loan for this project. The loan's face value and borrowing terms are unknown. However, it is known that the purpose of this loan was to cover the 70% of the over $700 million total project cost. The remaining 30% was expected to come in the form of an equity investment from CCCC (captured via Project ID #62080).The Private Use Terminal Construction Project at Porto São Luís is intended to improve supply chain operations in the agricultural industries from mid-West Brazil (States of Mato Grosso, Goiás, Tocantins, Pará, Maranhão, and Piauí). Works involve construction of a water port with four berths and supporting storage facilities. This is a greenfield private port terminal located in the Organized Port Complex of Itaqui, in the municipality of São Luís, State of Maranhão. The port would be strategically located to facilitate the export of grains coming from the mid-West and the imports of fertilizers, grain, oil, pulp, and other liquid bulks to the North region.Port San Luis was supposed to be jointly constructed by CCCC South America Regional Company, Concremat (subsidiary of CCCC), Second Harbor Engineering (SHEC, also a subsidiary of CCCC), Thorell, Lyon Capital, and WPR Participações. According to the Executive President of Concremat, 'most of the supply chain will be Brazilian, with specific equipment coming from China.' On March 16, 2018, CCCC signed the EPC agreement and the groundbreaking ceremony took place. Construction was scheduled to last three years. According to an August 2018 article from Concremat (a subsidiary of CCCC), workers had began earthworks and drilling onshore and offshore. The peak of work was expected to occur between June 2019 and April 2021. As of November 2021, Porto São Luís is scheduled to start operations in 2025.This project was constructed on a BOO+EPC basis meaning CCCC would build, own, and operate the port. In December 2017, CCCC officially completed the investment transaction and officially took a 51% controlling stake in the project. Lyon Capital owns 20% of stakes, WPR owns 24%, and the rest is held by unspecified shareholders.According to a document from April 2020, this project was stalled due to environmental issues and public backlash. The Port of San Luis is located in a vast mangrove area where local and migratory birds and various marine species breed. CCCC did not fulfill official requests to establish a conservation unit in the project area. There are also archaeological and a sacred historical sites that the CCCC has also failed to protect. The environmental licenses for this project have been obtained without consultation with affected human communities, especially the Cajueiro people. There have been reports that project developers have threatened local leaders, pressured communities to sell their land, unlawfully demolished houses, and destroyed forests. Brazilians are calling for the project to be canceled due to its negative environmental and social impacts. In 2019, local military forces have clashed with protestors attempting to protect their homes from demolition (see also 'Besieged by progress' and 'Public Letter' and 'São Luis megaport conflict intensifies').In November 2021, Cosan Group (a Brazilian company controlled by Atlântico Participações) signed an agreement with CCCC to acquire 100% of shares for the Private Use Terminal Construction Project at Porto São Luís. They immediately acquired the minority stake equal to 49% and will proceed with negotiations with CCCC for their 51% stake. A Cosan representative said that a “memorandum of understanding for the construction of the Port, aimed at the outflow of ore, was signed with Concremat and companies of the CCCC group. The definitive contracts for the construction of the port are conditioned to the closing of the acquisition of 100% of the shares of the port project.” The Government of Maranhao was involved in coordinating this change in ownership.

Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years. On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured Umbrella Project ID #62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID #62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID #62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company (National Port Development (SL) Ltd. ), project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability). The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017. This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.",Implementation,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Yes,OOF-like,Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank)|Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC),,National Port Development Ltd.

Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year.

Ream Naval Base,Cambodia,2016,91724,No,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,Chinese Government provides grant for Ream Naval Base Expansion Project,"On June 22, 2016, China First Metallurgical Group Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Metallurgical Group Corporation — and the Cambodian Ministry of Defense signed a framework cooperation agreement for the Ream Naval Base Expansion Project. The purpose of the project is to expand Ream Naval Base by constructing a 5,000-ton dry dock (or ship repairs) and a 1,500-ton side-launching mechanical slipway. The project also involves outfitting the quay, extending a pier, building a repair workshop, constructing a hospital, constructing a ‘reception building’, and adding 7.4 hectares of reclaimed land.Then, on June 24, 2019, Joseph Felter, then U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for South and Southeast Asia, sent a letter to Cambodia’s Defense Minister asking for more information about the Cambodian Government’s decision not to accept U.S. Government funding to repair facilities at Ream Naval Base.  On July 1, 2019, Reuters reported that a Cambodian Defense Ministry Spokesperson said, ‘At Ream, perhaps, there will be some changes in the future.’ Then, in July 2019, the Wall Street Journal reported that U.S, Government officials had seen a secret agreement that granted the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) exclusive access to about one-third of the Ream naval base for up to 30 years (with an automatic renewal every 10 years thereafter). In exchange, the Chinese Government reportedly agreed to fund the construction of new infrastructure at the base. Access to Ream Naval Base is significant in that it would give Beijing a new southern flank on the South China Sea, and only its second overseas naval foothold after its naval base in Djibouti.In early September 2020, the Cambodian Government demolished a U.S.-built facility at the base. Then, in October 2020, Vice-Admiral of the Royal Cambodian Navy Vann Bunlieng said that dredging work was being undertaken around the base in order to accommodate larger vessels — as part of a project supported by the Chinese Government. In May 2021, satellite imagery revealed that two new buildings had been rapidly constructed at the base, just north of the site of U.S.-funded facilities that were demolished by the Cambodian Government in 2020. The buildings measure approximately 115 feet long and 20 feet wide. Satellite imagery indicates that land clearing began sometime after April 17, 2021, construction started in early May 2021, and the structures were complete by May 21, 2021.Then, during her June 1, 2021 visit to Phnom Penh, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman raised concerns about the construction activities underway at Ream Naval Base. In response, Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Banh admitted that Beijing was helping build infrastructure at the base but he said it came with ‘no strings attached.’ When U.S. Government officials took up an offer from Prime Minister Hun Sen to visit the base on June 4, 2021, however, they said they were denied full access.Satellite imagery from Maxar Technologies and Planet Labs shows that two additional buildings were constructed toward the north of the base in early-to-mid August 2021. In late August 2021, work began on a new road from the naval base’s southeast gate to the coastal area housing the new facilities. That work was still ongoing as of early October 2021. Clearing work also began in August 2021 on a path stretching from the southeast end of the new roadway, around the back of a Vietnam-funded hospital north of the road, and then due west. This second potential roadway was on course to intersect a large area of ground that Cambodia cleared and then fenced off in 2019, just before the news of the Chinese access agreement broke in July 2019.In November 2021, the U.S. Government sanctioned two senior Cambodian defense officials over allegations of graft connected to construction financing at the Ream naval base. According to the U.S. Treasury, Chau Phirun (the Director-General of the Cambodian Defense Ministry’s Material and Technical Services Department) and Tea Vinh (Royal Cambodian Navy Commander) and ‘and other Cambodian government officials likely conspired to inflate the cost of facilities at Ream Naval Base and personally benefit from the proceeds. Tea and Chau planned to share funds skimmed from the Ream Naval Base project.’Then, between January 13, 2022 and January 13, 2022, Chinese clamshell dredgers and barges for collecting dredged sand arrived at the project site. On June 8, 2022, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place at the project site. Twenty-eight acres of land — over 15 percent of Ream’s total land area — was cleared in the center of the base between July 2022 and October 2022. The construction of on a new pier that began in June 2022 was completed in September 2022. Barges seen at the pier in a September 23, 2022 satellite image suggest it was being used to ferry in construction materials and equipment to relieve busy land routes. Around the same time, a clamshell dredger continued to operate offshore, deepening the harbor and suggesting the possibility of additional land reclamation. The construction of a cement manufacturing facility was completed in September 2022. By October 2022, two new buildings and foundations for eight more buildings were visible on the northern end of the base, where major land clearing occurred during the summer of 2022.Construction began on a second pier in October 2022. Then, in early February 2023, satellite imagery revealed ferries arranged in a uniform line extending far out from the second pier. Barges had been working on extending the pier consistently at that point, with the shadow of a tall crane for inserting pilings visible across the waters. Close inspection of the satellite imagery from revealed rows of pilings to act as the support for a permanent pier, with dimensions far in excess of those required to ferry construction materials. By the end of February 2023, the second pier had a total length of 685 meters, with 290 meters of usable docking space, and it had developed a distinctive shape, not seen at every staging area, but present at China’s only other naval base in foreign waters, off the coast of Djibouti.",Implementation,Military,Grant,Yes,Military,Unspecified Chinese Government Institution,,Cambodia Ministry of Defense,China First Metallurgical Construction Group Co.(CFMCC),,"$17,712,067.63",10.5068064,103.612477,https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/373163665,precise

This action came roughly four years before the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe resumed diplomatic relations (on December 26, 2017). Shortly after establishing a trade mission in São Tomé and Príncipe (on November 14, 2013), the Chinese Government expressed interest in funding the construction a deep-water seaport in São Tomé and Príncipe. The estimated cost of this project was $400 million. Its purpose was to facilitate the export of oil and sea-borne commerce. Then, in October 2015, the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) regarding the potential construction of the seaport as a Public-Private Partnership (PPP). The MOU specified that CHEC would first assess the feasibility of the project. Also, according to the MoU, CHEC reportedly pledged to invest at least $120 million. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), along with Macau Legend Development Ltd, also expressed interest in the deepwater seaport project. Then, in May 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe signed a bilateral cooperation agreement, in which the Chinese Government agreed to provide $146 million of funding for infrastructure projects between 2017 and 2022 to the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe (see Project ID#71266). One of the infrastructure projects identified in the bilateral cooperation agreement was the deepwater seaport project. However, in 2018, the Chinese Government began to raise concerns about the Government of São Tomé and Príncipe’s ability to take on substantially higher level public debt to facilitate the implementation of the project. In late November 2019, the STP’s Minister of Public Works, Infrastructure and Natural Resources, Osvaldo Abreu, announced the launch of the international tender for the construction of the deepwater port in the village of Fernão Dias within Lobata district. The project described in the international tender envisages a port with a depth of 16 meters and the construction of a multipurpose terminal with a capacity of up to 30,000 tons. The Government of the STP also invited construction companies to submit proposals to build the port according o a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) model, which suggests that this project may ultimately be financed through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).",Pipeline: Pledge,Mixed,Vague TBD,No,OOF-like,Unspecified Chinese Government Institution,,Government of São Tomé & Príncipe,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.

The total cost of the project was $350 million USD, and it was to be completed within two years (see '中国为伊朗恰巴哈尔港扩建工程提供融资').

Sierra Leone Fish Harbour,Sierra Leone,2019,62533,Yes,No,China (People's Republic of),0,0,Chinese Government provides RMB 450 million grant — via ECTA — for Fishery Harbor Project,"In August 2018, during an official visit to China, the Sierra Leonean President, Julius Maada Bio, signed an agreement with the Chinese Government regarding a feasibility study for a Fishery Harbor Project. Under the terms of the agreement, the Chinese Government agreed to dispatch a team of 9 experts to Sierra Leone to conduct a feasibility study for a project that would involve the construction of a fishing harbor (port) in the capital city of Freetown. Then, on February 1, 2019, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Sierra Leone and the Chinese Government signed an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (经济技术合作协议 or ECTA), which officially committed RMB 200 million (approximately $29.8 million) of grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project. However, in July 2021 Sierra Leone’s Parliament ratified an RMB 450 million grant agreement with the Chinese Government for the Fishery Harbor Project. The Chinese Government apparently increased the overall size of its grant commitment for the project by authorizing the use of RMB 250 million of additional grant funding for the Fishery Harbor Project that it had previously committed through an August 30, 2018 ECTA. The purpose of the project is to construct an industrial fishing harbor (port) — for tuna vessels and ‘other bigger fishing’ vessels exporting to international markets — at Black Johnson beach near a protected area called Western Area Peninsula national park. The project also involves a ‘waste-management component’ to ‘recycle marine and other wastes into useful products. Zhejiang Communications Investment Group Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Part of the land earmarked for the project is a lagoon in the dry season that opens up into a river during the rainy season. It acts as a fish breeding site, and its water flows into Whale Bay - renowned for whales, dolphins, turtles and many bird species – when it rains. Conservationists, human rights and animal welfare groups and local landowners, claim that the project would ‘destroy pristine rainforest, plunder fish stocks, pollute the marine environment and five individual ecosystems that are fish breeding grounds and support endangered bird and wildlife species.’ Two legal campaign groups, the Institute for Legal Research and Advocacy for Justice (ILRAJ) and Namati Sierra Leone, have written to the Government of Sierra Leone, under the 2013 Right to Access Information Act, demanding to see the environmental and social impact assessment studies for the project, and a government report showing that the beach was, as claimed, the most suitable place for construction ‘in terms of bathymetry, social safeguards (minimum resettlement costs) and environmental issues.’ They have also sought a copy of the grant agreement between the Chinese Government and the Government of Sierra Leone. Basita Michael, a lawyer for the ILRAJ, has said that ‘The press release was very vague. It left us wondering how did we arrive here and how come we are only hearing about this now. We have a right to know more.’ James Tonner, who owns land at Black Johnson with his mother, Jane Aspden Gbandewa, has written an open letter to the President of Sierra Leone, calling for him to intervene and stop the construction of the fishing port, which Tonner said would be ‘disastrous for the country and the planet’. In August 2021, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs made the following public remarks about the project: ‘The Sierra Leonean government and industry associations, as well as various sectors of society, have repeatedly clarified and expressed support for the project in Sierra Leone, which the parliament recently approved. The remarks of people from all walks of life in Sierra Leone clearly show that the construction of a modern fishing [harbor] has been the long-cherished wish of the Sierra Leonean people since the 1970s. The construction of the fishing [harbor] will significantly improve Sierra Leone's fishing infrastructure. On the issue of environmental assessment and land requisition, the government of Sierra Leone has pointed out that the siting of the project is the most appropriate arrangement based on considerations of multiple factors including the water depth and the environment. The Sierra Leonean side has commissioned a professional institution to conduct an environmental assessment and earmarked funds for compensation for the local landowners. According to the registration records of Sierra Leone's fishery authorities, there are now more than 100 industrial fishing vessels from 16 countries and regions operating in Sierra Leone. The completion of the fishing [harbor] will benefit not only the local people, but also the relevant enterprises operating in Sierra Leone. It is a win-win project for all parties. So the claims in this article about the fishmeal plant, destruction of surrounding rainforest, disregard for the local people, China hoovering up resources, are all untrue and untenable.’ As of January 2022, there was still no evidence that project implementation had commenced.",Pipeline: Commitment,Development,Grant,Yes,ODA-like,China Ministry of Commerce,,Government of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation,Zhejiang Communications Construction Group Co Ltd,,"$73,629,006.93",8.27212276,-13.16756,,approximate location

Then, in December 2020, a Chinese embassy official told the Samoa Observer that the feasibility study was still underway and the Vaiusu Port Project was experiencing delays due to Covid-19-related border closures. Approximately five months later, Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Samoa’s incoming Prime Minister (who was before that an opposition leader), pledged to cancel the $100 million Vaiusu Port Project. She called it ‘excessive’ and noted that the Government of Samoa was already heavily indebted to China. Then, in August 2021, she confirmed that the project had been ‘shelved’. The proposed wharf in Vaiusu Bay had become a divisive issue in Samoa, playing a part in the April 20221 national election where long-serving leader Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi lost his parliamentary majority.",Completion,Mixed,Grant,Yes,OOF-like,China Ministry of Commerce,,Government of Samoa,"CCCC-FHDI Engineering Co., Ltd.",,"$42,632.16",-13.823894,-171.79659,,approximate location

Ltd (CHEC) signed a deferred payment ('延期付款”) agreement for the Extension and Dredging Works of Berths 17 and 18 at Port Sudan Project. The loan carried an 8-year maturity and the borrower (SPC) was expected to make monthly repayments with the retained (ring-fenced) portion of its monthly operating income. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, is is known that SPC used the deferred payment arrangement to finance a $110 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd on June 8, 2006.The purpose of the project was to construct two 70,000-ton (TEU) container terminals at Port Sudan (Berths 17 and 18). The total length of the terminals is 781 meters with a water depth of 16 meters. The project scope also included dredging activities (for a foundation trench, turning basin, main channel) with a total volume of 3.5 million cubic meters. CHEC was the contractor responsible for implementation.Project implementation commenced in January 2007. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 30 months (July 2009). As of December 2009, construction of the main terminals and ancillary works were complete, but site cleaning activities had not yet been undertaken. The project was ultimately completed in February 2011. An official project completion ceremony was held on December 21, 2011.However, the deferred payment (lending) arrangement between SPC and CHEC appears to have underperformed vis-à-vis the original expectations of CHEC. Sudan’s Ministry of Finance initially set up a special bank account into which SPC deposited its monthly operating income (worth approximately $200 million a year), and SPC was allowed to retain some but not all of these funds for its own purposes (such as construction and maintenance of port facilities and servicing its debts to CHEC). However, Sudan’s Ministry of Finance subsequently took away SPC’s ability to retain a portion of its monthly income around 2011 (when the Sudanese Government faced an acute foreign exchange shortage), which made it substantially more difficult for SPC to honor its monthly repayment obligations. CHEC later disclosed that SPC was in arrears but continued to make interest payments.",Completion,Mixed,Loan (excluding debt rescheduling),Vague,OOF-like,"China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd.
